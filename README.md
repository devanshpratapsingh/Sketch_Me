It is a very very simple sketch generation python script which uses OpenCV.

This is done is simple 5 steps-
1. Import image
<img src="imgs/1.png" height="400px" width="300px">
2. Convert it to Grayscale
 
3. Invert the image using Bitwise_Not
 
4. Using Gaussian_Blur to remove high-frequency components

5. Implementing dodging for getting the final output.
